## Structure for this course

- We will use the foundation built in BSTA 511/611 or EPID 525

 

-   We will be building towards models that can handle many variables!

     

    -   **Regression** is the building block for modeling multivariable relationships

     

-   In Linear Models we will *build, interpret, and evaluate* **linear regression models**

## What we will cover: process for regression data analysis

## Let me know if you have questions

Or if there's any contradicting information in the course site... I'm sure I made a mistake somewhere!!

- For example: we do NOT have quizzes. If you see a mention of quizzes anywhere in the course, then I simply overlooked it and need to fix it!
