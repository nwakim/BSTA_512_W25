2.  Using the F-test, determine if there is enough evidence that
    population slope $\beta_1$ is not 0
    
3.  Using the F-test, determine if there is enough evidence for association between an outcome and a categorical variable

4.  Calculate and interpret the coefficient of determination


## Getting to the F-test

The F statistic in linear regression is essentially a proportion of the
variance explained by the model vs. the variance not explained by the
model

1.  Start with visual of explained vs. unexplained variation

2.  Figure out the mathematical representations of this variation

3.  Look at the ANOVA table to establish key values measuring our
    variance from our model

4.  Build the F-test

    $\overline{Y}$
    -   (the **total** amount deviation unexplained at $X_i$ ).
-   $Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i$ = the deviation of the observation $Y$ around the
    fitted regression line
    -   (the amount deviation **unexplained** by the regression at $X_i$
        ).
-   $\widehat{Y_i}- \overline{Y}$ = the deviation of the fitted value
    $\widehat{Y}_i$ around the mean $\overline{Y}$
    -   (the amount deviation **explained** by the regression at $X_i$ )

# Learning Objectives

1.  Identify different sources of variation in an Analysis of Variance
    (ANOVA) table

::: lob
2.  Using the F-test, determine if there is enough evidence that
    population slope $\beta_1$ is not 0
:::
    
3.  Using the F-test, determine if there is enough evidence for association between an outcome and a categorical variable

4.  Calculate and interpret the coefficient of determination


## What is the F statistic testing?

$$F = \frac{MSR}{MSE}$$

-   It can be shown that

$$E(MSE)=\sigma^2\ \text{and}\ E(MSR) = \sigma^2 + \beta_1^2\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i- \overline{X})^2$$

-   Recall that $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the population residuals
-   Thus if
    -   $\beta_1 = 0$, then
        $F \approx \frac{\widehat{\sigma}^2}{\widehat{\sigma}^2} = 1$
    -   $\beta_1 \neq 0$, then
        $F \approx \frac{\widehat{\sigma}^2 + \widehat{\beta}_1^2\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i- \overline{X})^2}{\widehat{\sigma}^2} > 1$
-   So the $F$ statistic can also be used to test $\beta_1$

## F-test vs. t-test for the population slope

The square of a $t$-distribution with $df = \nu$ is an $F$-distribution
with $df = 1, \nu$

$$T_{\nu}^2 \sim F_{1,\nu}$$

-   We can use either F-test or t-test to run the following hypothesis
    test:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
H_0 &: \beta_1 = 0\\
\text{vs. } H_A&: \beta_1 \neq 0
\end{align}
```

-   Note that the F-test does not support one-sided alternative tests,
    but the t-test does!
    
    - F-test cannot handle alternatives like $\beta_1 > 0$ nor $\beta_2 < 0$

## Planting a seed about the F-test

We can think about the hypothesis test for the slope...

::: columns
::: {.column width="17%"}
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: proof1
::: proof-title
Null $H_0$
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: definition
::: def-title
Alternative $H_1$
:::

::: def-cont
$\beta_1\neq0$
:::
:::
:::
:::

in a slightly different way...

::: columns
::: {.column width="17%"}
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: proof1
::: proof-title
Null model ($\beta_1=0$)
:::

::: proof-cont
-   $Y = \beta_0 + \epsilon$
-   Smaller (reduced) model
:::
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: definition
::: def-title
Alternative model ($\beta_1\neq0$)
:::

::: def-cont
-   $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$
-   Larger (full) model
:::
:::
:::
:::

-   In multiple linear regression, we can start using this framework to
    test multiple coefficient parameters at once

    -   Decide whether or not to reject the smaller reduced model in
        favor of the larger full model

    -   Cannot do this with the t-test when we have multiple coefficients!

## Poll Everywhere Question 2

\text{vs. } H_A&: \beta_1 \neq 0
\end{align}
```

3.  Specify the significance level.
:::
:::

Often we use $\alpha = 0.05$

::: highlight-container

4.  Specify the test statistic and its distribution under the null
:::
:::

The test statistic is $F$, and follows an F-distribution with numerator
$df=1$ and denominator $df=n-2$.
:::

::: {.column width="4%"}
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: highlight-container
::: highlight
5.  Compute the value of the test statistic
:::
:::

The calculated **test statistic** for $\widehat\beta_1$ is

$$F = \frac{MSR}{MSE}$$

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
6.  Calculate the p-value
:::
:::

We are generally calculating: $P(F_{1, n-2} > F)$

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
7.  Write conclusion for hypothesis test
:::
:::

-   Reject: $P(F_{1, n-2} > F) < \alpha$

We (reject/fail to reject) the null hypothesis that the slope is 0 at
the $100\alpha\%$ significiance level. There is
(sufficient/insufficient) evidence that there is significant association
between ($Y$) and ($X$) (p-value = $P(F_{1, n-2} > F)$).
:::

## Life expectancy example: hypothesis test for population **slope** $\beta_1$

    ANOVA table

$$F = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = \frac{2052.81}{37.73}=54.414$$

-   **Option 2:** Get the test statistic value (F) from the ANOVA table

6.  Calculate the p-value
:::
:::

-   As per Step 4, test statistic $F$ can be modeled by a
    $F$-distribution with $df1 = 1$ and $df2 = n-2$.

    -   We had 80 countries' data, so $n=80$

-   **Option 1:** Use `pf()` and our calculated test statistic

```{r}
# p-value is ALWAYS the right tail for F-test
pf(54.414, df1 = 1, df2 = 78, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

-   **Option 2:** Use the ANOVA table

```{r}
anova(model1) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40)
```

## Life expectancy example: hypothesis test for population **slope** $\beta_1$ (4/4)

::: highlight-container
::: highlight
7.  Write conclusion for the hypothesis test
:::
:::

We reject the null hypothesis that the slope is 0 at the $5\%$
significance level. There is sufficient evidence that there is
significant association between female life expectancy and female
literacy rates (p-value \< 0.0001).

## Did you notice anything about the p-value?

The p-value of the t-test and F-test are the same!!

-   For the t-test:

```{r}
tidy(model1) %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40)
```

-   For the F-test:

```{r}
anova(model1) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40)
```

This is true when we use the F-test for a single coefficient!

# Learning Objectives

    (ANOVA) table

2.  Using the F-test, determine if there is enough evidence that
    population slope $\beta_1$ is not 0

3.  Using the F-test, determine if there is enough evidence for association between an outcome and a categorical variable
:::

4.  Calculate and interpret the coefficient of determination


## Testing association between continuous outcome and categorical variable

- Before we used the F-test (or t-test) to determine association between two continuous variables
- We CANNOT use the t-test to determine association between a continuous outcome and a multi-level categorical variable
- We CAN use the F-test to do this!

 

- We can use the t-test or F-test for a categorical variable with only 2 levels

## Poll Everywhere Question 3
    
## Building a very important toolkit: three types of tests

::: fact
::: fact-title
Overall test (in a couple classes)
:::

::: fact-cont
Does at least one of the covariates/predictors contribute significantly to the prediction of Y?
:::
:::

::: example
::: ex-title
Test for addition of a single variable (covariate subset test)
:::

::: ex-cont
Does the addition of one particular covariate add significantly to the prediction of Y achieved by other covariates already present in the model?
:::
:::

::: proposition
::: prop-title
Test for addition of group of variables (covariate subset test) (in a couple classes)
:::

::: prop-cont
Does the addition of some group of covariates add significantly to the prediction of Y achieved by other covariates already present in the model?
:::
:::

## When running a F-test for linear models...

-   We need to define a larger, full model (more parameters)
-   We need to define a smaller, reduced model (fewer parameters)
-   Use the F-statistic to decide whether or not we reject the smaller model
    -   The F-statistic compares the SSE of each model to determine if the full model explains a significant amount of additional variance

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
 

$$
F = \dfrac{\frac{SSE(R) - SSE(F)}{df_R - df_F}}{\frac{SSE(F)}{df_F}}
$$
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   $SSE(R) \geq SSE(F)$
-   Numerator measures difference in **unexplained** variation between the models
    -   Big difference = added parameters greatly reduce the unexplained variation (increase explained variation)
    -   Smaller difference = added parameters don't reduce the unexplained variation
-   Take ratio of difference to the unexplained variation in the full model

6.  Calculate the p-value

-   As per Step 4, test statistic $F$ can be modeled by a
    $F$-distribution with $df1 = 3$ and $df2 = n-4$.

    -   We had 80 countries' data, so $n=80$

-   **Option 1:** Use `pf()` and our calculated test statistic

```{r}
# p-value is ALWAYS the right tail for F-test
pf(33.5331, df1 = 3, df2 = 76, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

-   **Option 2:** Use the ANOVA table

```{r}
anova(model2) %>% tidy() %>% gt() %>%
  tab_options(table.font.size = 40)
```

7.  Write conclusion for the hypothesis test
:::
:::

We reject the null hypothesis that all three coefficients are equal to 0 at the $5\%$
significance level. There is sufficient evidence that there is
association between female life expectancy and the country's world region (p-value \< 0.0001).


# Learning Objectives

1.  Identify different sources of variation in an Analysis of Variance
    (ANOVA) table

2.  Using the F-test, determine if there is enough evidence that
    population slope $\beta_1$ is not 0
    
3.  Using the F-test, determine if there is enough evidence for association between an outcome and a categorical variable

## Correlation coefficient from 511

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
Correlation coefficient $r$ can tell us about the strength of a
relationship **between two continuous variables**

-   If $r = -1$, then there is a perfect negative linear relationship
    between $X$ and $Y$

-   If $r = 1$, then there is a perfect positive linear relationship
    between $X$ and $Y$

-   If $r = 0$, then there is no linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$

Note: All other values of $r$ tell us that the relationship between $X$
and $Y$ is not perfect. The closer $r$ is to 0, the weaker the linear
relationship.

## Correlation coefficient ($r$ or $R$)

::: columns
::: column
The (Pearson) correlation coefficient $r$ of variables $X$ and $Y$ can
be computed using the formula:

$$\begin{aligned}
r  & = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})(Y_i - \overline{Y})}{\Big(\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2\Big)^{1/2}} \\
& = \frac{SSXY}{\sqrt{SSX \cdot SSY}}
\end{aligned}$$

we have the relationship

$$\widehat{\beta}_1 = r\frac{SSY}{SSX},\ \ \text{or},\ \  r = \widehat{\beta}_1\frac{SSX}{SSY}$$

## Coefficient of determination: $R^2$

It can be shown that the square of the correlation coefficient $r$ is
equal to

$$R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SSY} = \frac{SSY - SSE}{SSY}$$

-   $R^2$ is called the **coefficient of determination**.
-   **Interpretation**: The proportion of variation in the $Y$ values explained by the
        regression model
-   $R^2$ measures the strength of the **linear** relationship between $X$
    and $Y$:
    -   $R^2 = \pm 1$: Perfect relationship
        -   Happens when $SSE = 0$, i.e. no error, all points on the
            line
    -   $R^2 = 0$: No relationship
        -   Happens when $SSY = SSE$, i.e. using the line doesn't not
            improve model fit over using $\overline{Y}$ to model the $Y$
            values.

## What does $R^2$ not measure?

::: columns
::: {.column width="37%"}
-   $R^2$ is not a measure of the magnitude of the slope of the
    regression line

    -   Example: can have $R^2 = 1$ for many different slopes!!

-   $R^2$ is not a measure of the appropriateness of the straight-line
    model
