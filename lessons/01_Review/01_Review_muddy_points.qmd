### 1. F-distribution??

### 2. Linear combination of Normal RVs are Normal

## Muddy points from Winter 2024

### 1. Relationship between distributions

Just to clarify! We will be using the distributions in the context of hypothesis testing. I just wanted you to see some of the cool connections between the distributions. (We don't need to know the connections for a lot of what we do in this class.)

Also, I will discuss each distribution again as we hit the hypothesis tests that use them!

There is a big, scary (but fun!) infographic at the end of a famous stat textbook (Casella and Berger) that shows all the connections between distributions:

![](../img_muddy_points/CB_distributions.png)

We mostly talk about the red, circled area. Each line with the directional arrow represents a specific transformation that is needed to go from the starting distribution to the distribution at the end of the arrow.

**Again, this is NOT information we need to perform regression, but it is really interesting to see the connections between these distributions.**

### 2. A word about the distributions

I feel like I might've scared us with all the distribution talk.

I want to be clear: We will further discuss and explore the distributions as we use them within the course. It will be more important **to understand their use within regression** then knowing the distribution in depth. **Basically, when we implement specific hypothesis tests, we just need to know which distribution is most appropriate for the test.**

### 3. Is the F distribution used for things outside of ANOVA?

Yes! In regression, we often use the F-distribution through the F-test (same as ANOVA) However, in regression, we are comparing the variance of two models, that may differ by a coefficient. [See the STAT 501 page for more info if interested.](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/6/6.2) In ANOVA, we are comparing variance between and within groups. Both use the same test, but with different goals!

### 4. Multivariable vs multivariate?

Some people misuse "multivariate" instead of "multivariable" modeling. In this class, we will only look at multivariable regression. Here's the big difference:

-   **Multivariable:** model with **multiple independent variables** (covariates, predictors)
    -   If we want to see how our outcome (height) is related to parent height, birth country, sex assigned at birth, etc.
-   **Multivariate:** model with **multiple dependent variables** (outcome)
    -   If we want to extend the outcome from height to height and head circumference. Multivariate modeling would try to model both outcomes together and see how they are related to other variables.
