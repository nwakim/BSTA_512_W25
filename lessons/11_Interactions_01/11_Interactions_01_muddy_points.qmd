## Muddy Points from Winter 2025

## Muddy Points from Winter 2024

### 1. Can we use continuous covariates in an interaction model?

Yes! Here are the four types of interactions we'll discuss:

1.  binary categorical and continuous

2.  multi-level categorical and continuous

3.  binary categorical and multi-level categorical

4.  continuous and continuous

### 2. Synergerism vs. antagonism: how does $\beta_3$ relate to each?

-   Synergerism means the sign of interaction's coefficient ($\beta_3$) matches that of main effect of $X_1$, so the effect of $X_1$ is strengthened as $X_2$ increases

    -   In the case that we're looking at $X_2$ as an effect modifier of $X_1$

    -   It's a little hard to think about this when we've only discussed $X_2$ as a binary covariate, but our "increase" for an indicator is going from 0 to 1.

-   Antagonism means the sign of interaction's coefficient ($\beta_3$) is flipped from that of main effect of $X_1$, so the effect of $X_1$ is weakened as $X_2$ increases

    -   In the case that we're looking at $X_2$ as an effect modifier of $X_1$

    -   It's a little hard to think about this when we've only discussed $X_2$ as a binary covariate, but our "increase" for an indicator is going from 0 to 1

### 3. The red and green lines example. I'm not totally sure why the lines would be parallel if an interaction affects the slope of a line?

The lines should not be parallel if there is an interaction. Let me show the equation for each of those examples:

-   Here is the plot and equation when $X_2$ is a confounder:

-   Here is the plot and equation when $X_2$ is an effect modifier:

-   Here is the plot and equation when $X_2$ is a effect modifier:

-   Here is the plot and equation when $X_2$ should not be in the model:
