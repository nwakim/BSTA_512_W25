Interactions in general\n\n#### 1.1 Why is it not an effect modifier if p-value is 0.4? Or why is it not significant? Is it because it is not = 0?\n\n#### 1.2 What are some reasons why we would think an effect modifier might exist in our data? or are we testing indiscriminately/ based on our own perspective of the associations in the data\n\n#### 1.3 I'm still not entirely sure I know how to do all the steps of interaction models, but I think part of that may just be me needing to look at my previous notes.\n\n### 2. Centering the continuous covariate\n\n#### 2.1 How does centering help with interpretation?\n\nI think [this blog post](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/when-not-to-center-a-predictor-variable-in-regression/) has a nice explanation.\n\nBut for an example from our class... centering female literacy rate can help us interpret the... randomly stopped typing...\n\n#### 2.2 Why do some values of $\\beta$ change after centering the mean and others don't?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
