F-distribution??\n\n### 2. Linear combination of Normal RVs are Normal\n\n## Muddy points from Winter 2024\n\n### 1. Relationship between distributions\n\nJust to clarify! We will be using the distributions in the context of hypothesis testing. I just wanted you to see some of the cool connections between the distributions. (We don't need to know the connections for a lot of what we do in this class.)\n\nAlso, I will discuss each distribution again as we hit the hypothesis tests that use them!\n\nThere is a big, scary (but fun!) infographic at the end of a famous stat textbook (Casella and Berger) that shows all the connections between distributions:\n\n![](../img_muddy_points/CB_distributions.png)\n\nWe mostly talk about the red, circled area. Each line with the directional arrow represents a specific transformation that is needed to go from the starting distribution to the distribution at the end of the arrow.\n\n**Again, this is NOT information we need to perform regression, but it is really interesting to see the connections between these distributions.**\n\n### 2. A word about the distributions\n\nI feel like I might've scared us with all the distribution talk.\n\nI want to be clear: We will further discuss and explore the distributions as we use them within the course. It will be more important **to understand their use within regression** then knowing the distribution in depth. **Basically, when we implement specific hypothesis tests, we just need to know which distribution is most appropriate for the test.**\n\n### 3. Is the F distribution used for things outside of ANOVA?\n\nYes! In regression, we often use the F-distribution through the F-test (same as ANOVA) However, in regression, we are comparing the variance of two models, that may differ by a coefficient. [See the STAT 501 page for more info if interested.](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/6/6.2) In ANOVA, we are comparing variance between and within groups. Both use the same test, but with different goals!\n\n### 4. Multivariable vs multivariate?\n\nSome people misuse \"multivariate\" instead of \"multivariable\" modeling. In this class, we will only look at multivariable regression. Here's the big difference:\n\n-   **Multivariable:** model with **multiple independent variables** (covariates, predictors)\n    -   If we want to see how our outcome (height) is related to parent height, birth country, sex assigned at birth, etc.\n-   **Multivariate:** model with **multiple dependent variables** (outcome)\n    -   If we want to extend the outcome from height to height and head circumference. Multivariate modeling would try to model both outcomes together and see how they are related to other variables.\n\n### 5. More on the functions and problems we had in class!\n\n::: callout-important\nThis section has some examples from [this YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THGFXV4RW8U&list=PLiC1doDIe9rC8RgWPAWqDETE-VbKOWfWl&ab_channel=DataDaft). There is a video on mutate, pipe, filter, select, rename, arrange, and summarize. Note that some of the function in the series is outdated. The use of `if_else()` in the video is outdated, and it is more common to use `case_when()` now. The use of `gather` and `spread` have been replaced by `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`.\n:::\n\nTo discuss these functions below, I want to use a different dataset than what we used for examples in class. I'm hoping this allows us to see each function from a different angle. I'll use the dataset that we used for some of the `ggplot` examples: `mtcars`. Let's load the tidyverse and take a look at the dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nglimpse(mtcars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 32\nColumns: 11\n$ mpg  <dbl> 21.0, 21.0, 22.8, 21.4, 18.7, 18.1, 14.3, 24.4, 22.8, 19.2, 17.8,…\n$ cyl  <dbl> 6, 6, 4, 6, 8, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8,…\n$ disp <dbl> 160.0, 160.0, 108.0, 258.0, 360.0, 225.0, 360.0, 146.7, 140.8, 16…\n$ hp   <dbl> 110, 110, 93, 110, 175, 105, 245, 62, 95, 123, 123, 180, 180, 180…\n$ drat <dbl> 3.90, 3.90, 3.85, 3.08, 3.15, 2.76, 3.21, 3.69, 3.92, 3.92, 3.92,…\n$ wt   <dbl> 2.620, 2.875, 2.320, 3.215, 3.440, 3.460, 3.570, 3.190, 3.150, 3.…\n$ qsec <dbl> 16.46, 17.02, 18.61, 19.44, 17.02, 20.22, 15.84, 20.00, 22.90, 18…\n$ vs   <dbl> 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0,…\n$ am   <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,…\n$ gear <dbl> 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3,…\n$ carb <dbl> 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2,…\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
