**Brief professor statement:** As a professor, my main goal is to
instill a growth mindset into my students. Growth mindset means we are
NOT stuck in our abilities or knowledge, and that we all can and will
grow! This course aims to be as transparent as possible. I want you to
understand my motivation for assessments, questions, and lessons. I also
want those assessments to be clear, so please ask for clarification
whenever needed.

## Academic Success Center Tutors

The Academic Success Center has biostatistics/epidemiology tutors available. Unlike TAs, tutors are not closely associated with any particular course sections or professors, nor do they have any grading responsibilities. Consider meeting with a tutor when you feel stuck on a project, need help with R coding, want to review course concepts, or simply complete assignments in a social learning environment. There is no cost to use tutoring. 
 
**Your tutors this year are Mickey McVeety (MPH Epi program) and Sofia Chapela Lara (PhD program).** They are looking forward to working with you in a one-to-one or group setting, depending on your needs. Please schedule to meet with them at least 24 hours in advance. If you have questions about tutoring or need assistance with the schedule, contact one of the tutors or the Academic Success Center:  <mcveety@ohsu.edu>, <chapelal@ohsu.edu>, <learningsupport@ohsu.edu>
