# Homework 2

## A small word on the homework

-   Mostly good work! 
- Main note: Please look at the solutions to make sure you have the correct beta's and interpretations when we work with categorical variables!!

# Lab 2

## A note from me

- I know the lab instructions are wordy
- This class is really about the technical ("objective") skills of regression
  - But in order to responsibly practice statistics, you need to critically think about the **subjective** choices you make
- And I'm really trying to lay out my thought process in the labs so that you have some idea of the subjective choices that I'm kinda restricting us to
  - And that's really just bc you're learning A LOT in this class
  - So taking on extra learning objectives would be overwhelming

## Other overall issues

- No need to load the codebook into R!!!
  - Codebooks are typically opened in excel and will give you extra information on the variables
  
- You gotta show all your code!
  - If you got points off for not showing any code, resubmit with the code showing and I'll give you credit back
  
- Be careful when making assumptions about the data
  - Example: someone created a cisgender variable by seeing if SAB was the same as gender identity
    - I would be wary of that - definitions of cis and trans are highly personal - only use and refer to participants as they self-identify
  
- Do **not** immediately make age categories!! It is important to look at age (numeric) vs. IAT
  - Why pixelate your data?? We only do it if we need to (aka age as numeric is NOT linear with IAT score)
  

## 3.1: What is our target population?

- This is an important thing to flag as you analyze your results and interpret them for an audience

 

- We restricted our population to the US
- Harvard says the test is only for individuals 18+ years old
- Test takers need access to the internet and a computer (or phone?)
  
 

- Another thought
  - Sometimes your target population defines your sample
  - Other times your sample defines your target population
- Here we have a convenience sample, with specific restrictions and accessibility
  - That means the population that we can generalize to is limited to those restrictions and accessibility!!
- **We need to discuss these limitations when we present these results to the world!**


## 3.2 Restrict your analysis to 1 outcome and 9 possible covariates/predictors

::: columns
::: column
Needed to pick the variable from your research question + 2 others (or 3 if you chose a different variable in your research question)

1.  Explicit anti-fat bias (`att7`)
2.  Self-perception of weight (`iam_001`)
3.  Fat group identity (`identfat_001` )
4.  Thin group identity (`identthen_001` )
5.  Controllability of weight of others (`controlother_001`)
6.  Controllability of weight of yourself (`controlyou_001`)
7.  Awareness of societal standards (`mostpref_001` )
8.  Internalization of societal standards (`important_001`)
:::

::: column
Needed to include all 4 demographic variables:

1.  Age (we need to construct from `birthmonth`, `birthyear`, `testmonth`, and `testyear`)
2.  Race (`raceomb_002` **or** `raceombmulti`) 
3.  Ethnicity (`ethnicityomb`)
4.  Sex assigned at birth (`birthSex`)

Please pick only 2 additional variables:

1.  Education (`edu_14`)
2.  Gender (`genderIdentity`)
3.  Self-reported BMI (through self-reported height and weight)
4.  Political identity
5.  Religion

## 3.2 Restrict your analysis to 1 outcome and 9 possible covariates/predictors

- Start by loading the data

```{r}
load(file = here("../Project/data/iat_data.rda"))
iat_2021 = iat_2021 %>% 
  select(IAT_score = D_biep.Thin_Good_all, 
         att7, iam_001, identfat_001, 
         myweight_002, myheight_002,
         identthin_001, controlother_001, 
         controlyou_001, mostpref_001,
         important_001, 
         birthmonth, birthyear, month, year, 
         raceomb_002, raceombmulti, ethnicityomb, 
         edu, edu_14, 
         genderIdentity, 
         birthSex) %>%
  drop_na()
```

## 3.3: Manipulating variables that are coded as numeric variables

- No need to make plots here (that was just part of my example)
  - Plots and tables are a good way to check that you accomplished the correct translation
- Giving the levels order:

```{r}
iat_2021 = iat_2021 %>% mutate(iam_001_f = case_match(iam_001,
                                  7 ~ "Very overweight",
                                  6 ~ "Moderately overweight",
                                  5 ~ "Slightly overweight",
                                  4 ~ "Neither underweight nor underweight",
                                  3 ~ "Slightly underweight",
                                  2 ~ "Moderately underweight",
                                  1 ~ "Very underweight",
                                  .default = NA) %>% 
             factor(levels = c("Very underweight", # Assigns the level order!
                               "Moderately underweight", 
                               "Slightly underweight", 
                               "Neither underweight nor underweight", 
                               "Slightly overweight", 
                               "Moderately overweight", 
                               "Very overweight")))
```

## 3.3: Manipulating variables that are coded as numeric variables

- Now when we print a table, we can see them in order

```{r}
iat_2021 %>%
  dplyr::select(iam_001_f) %>%
  tbl_summary()
```

## 3.5 If you chose BMI, create the variable

- If you worked with BMI, please make sure [you followed the help page!](https://nwakim.github.io/BSTA_512_W25/labs/BMI_help.html)
- Please come double check with me that you are creating it correctly!

## 4.3 Bivariate exploratory data analysis

- You only needed to create one plot!!
- My research question: Is self-perception of weight associated with IAT score?

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: How I made the plot


ggplot(iat_2021, aes(x = iam_001_f, y = IAT_score))+
  geom_boxplot()+
   labs(x = "Self-perception of weight", 
       y = "IAT Score", 
       title = "IAT Score by self-perception of weight") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 1, hjust=1))
```

          show.legend = FALSE) +

       x = "IAT Score", 
       title = "IAT Score by self-perception of weight") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

# Multi-selection/multi-response variables

## Multi-response/multi-selection variables: `raceombmulti` and `genderIdentity`

-   There is extra data management skills that we need to address these

- [Let's walk through categorical variables that have multiple selections](https://weallcount.com/2022/10/27/4-approaches-to-multiple-race-questions/)

- Another note: I find that the race variable is still lacking (where is my MENA representation??)
    - MENA = Middle Eastern and North African

## 4 Approaches to Multiple-Race Questions from We All Count

-   This method works for any multi-level variable

## Final notes

- For now, I suggest the binary approach!
  - This is the perfect level of pushing ourselves coding wise and thinking critically about these multi-response variables
- Take a look at this article: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.12.026>
  - It gets into some of the considerations and uses of intersectionality in analyses
